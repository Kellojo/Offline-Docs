# What is Offline Markdown Docs?

Offline Markdown Docs is a CLI tool that allows you to create offline documentation from markdown files. It takes all your markdown files, processes them, and outputs a single HTML file that contains all your documentation, complete with embedded images and syntax highlighting for code blocks and much more.

The created file is a **standalone HTML file that can be opened in any web browser, without the need for an internet connection** or any additional dependencies.

Want to know how to get started? Check out the [Quickstart](#Quickstart) guide.
