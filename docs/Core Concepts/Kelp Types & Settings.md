# Kelp Settings & Types
Each kelp instance has a kelp setting assigned. This kelp setting dictates how the kelp is rendered in the scene and influences many aspects such as color, leaf size and many more properties.

Kelp settings are stored as scriptable objects and can be created by clicking `Create > Stylized Kelp > Kelp Settings`. From there you can customize the kelp to your liking. Many properties can be updated at runtime so make sure to hit play and then start adjusting.
