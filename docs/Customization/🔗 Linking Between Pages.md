# Linking between pages

You can link between different pages by using the following syntax:

```
[Link to another page](#Core-Concepts/CodeTest)
```

Where `Core-Concepts/CodeTest` is the slugified path to the page you want to link to.

You can also link to specific headings within a page by appending `?h=Heading-Name` to the URL:

```
[Link to another page with heading](#Core-Concepts/Understanding-Core-Concepts?h=Kelp-Settings-2)
```

Where `Kelp-Settings-2` is the slugified version of the heading you want to link to.

This link here will take you to [Images](#Customization/Images) section and this to the [Building the docs](#Quickstart?h=Building-the-docs) heading.
