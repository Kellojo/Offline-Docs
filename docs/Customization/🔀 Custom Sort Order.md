# Custom Sort Order

Entries (either folders or md files) can have a custom order assigned as follows:

**Markdown Files**
Put this yaml metadata at the top of your file:

```yaml
---
order: 1
---
```

**Folder Customization**
Add a metadata.yaml file to your folder, which contains the metadata:

```yaml
---
order: 1
---
```
